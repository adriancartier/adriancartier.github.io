There is so much to be discovered in publicly available datasets, in particular, the US FDA has a large set of curated database that they have kindly made available for all to use, alongside with a nicely developed API. There are currently 6 main endpoints, ranging from information regarding animal and veterinary products, prescription and OTC drugs, to health devices and other information as the database gets updated [(learn more from their website)](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/).  To explore that, I'd like to start with their `drug events` endpoint, which gathers adverse events for prescription and over the counter medicines submitted voluntarily to the FDA.

Some prerequisites:

- I've downloaded the metadata yaml file for this endpoint to better understand the data structure, it is imported in the following code as `fields.yaml`. More information can be found on the [`searchable fields`](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/searchable-fields) session on their website.

- I've also requested an API key (free) which is stored in a file called `constant.py`


## Gathering the data :

```python
import requests
import os
# import personal API key
import constant
import pandas as pd
import json
from pandas.io.json import json_normalize
import numpy as np
import time
import datetime
from joblib import delayed, Parallel

from ruamel.yaml import YAML
from pathlib import Path

# read in list of searchable fields
path = Path('fields.yaml')
yaml = YAML(typ='safe')
fields = yaml.load(path)
keys = constant.keys

pd.options.display.max_columns =  None

```
### Inspecting the searchable fields

The json output of this API is highly nested, which can be a pain to deal with. Fortunately, with the data dictionary we can find out just which keys represetned nested arrays, so we can work on flatten them later. To do that, I've written a script to parse through the `fields.yaml` file downloaded from open FDA.


```python

class get_fda_keys:


    def __init__(self,fields):

        self.key_types = get_key_type(fields=fields)
        field_key_list = self.key_types['field_key_list']
        nested_keys = self.key_types['nested_key_names']      

        # nested level  = 0
        self.single_keys = [i for i in set(field_key_list) - set(nested_keys)]


        # nested level = 1
        self.patient_keys = [val for val in set(fields['properties']['patient']['properties'].keys())- {'drug','reaction'}]

        self.reaction_keys = [val for val in set(fields['properties']['patient']['properties']['reaction']['items']['properties'].keys())]
        # nested level = 2
        self.drug_keys = [val for val in set(fields['properties']['patient']['properties']['drug']['items']['properties'].keys()) - {'openfda'}]

        # nested level = 3
        self.openfda_keys = [val for val in set(fields['properties']['patient']['properties']['drug']['items']['properties']['openfda']['properties'].keys())]

        self.primsource_keys = [val for val in set(fields['properties']['primarysource']['properties'].keys()) - {'literaturereference'}]


```

We can use the class defined above to identify nested fields:

```python
fda_keys = get_fda_keys(fields= fields)

```

**output**

```
The following keys are arrays or objects:
['patient', 'primarysource', 'receiver', 'reportduplicate', 'sender']

```

### Helper functions to make API calls and flatten data:

```python

def fda_api(key,sd,ed):

    time.sleep(1)

    # initialize output dataframe
    output = pd.DataFrame()

    base_url = 'https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?api_key='+key

    search_term = '&search=receivedate:['+str(sd)+'+TO+'+str(ed)+']+AND+patient.patientonsetage:[1.0+TO+40000.0]+AND+patient.patientsex:[1+TO+2]&sort=receivedate:desc&limit=100'

    url = base_url + search_term

    r = requests.get(url)

    if r.status_code == 200:   

        print('query succesful, getting data now:')

        data = r.json()

        return data

    else:

        print('Query unsuccesful, status_code: '+str(r.status_code))

        return None


```

The function returns a dictionary, and from the metadata we can tell that the data is stored in the `results` section of it.  

```python
test = fda_api(key=keys['API_KEY'],sd ='20110101',ed = '20110102')
test.get('results')[0].keys()
```

**output**

```
7
dict_keys(['receiptdateformat', 'receiver', 'seriousnessdeath', 'companynumb', 'receivedateformat', 'primarysource', 'transmissiondateformat', 'fulfillexpeditecriteria', 'safetyreportid', 'sender', 'receivedate', 'patient', 'seriousnesshospitalization', 'transmissiondate', 'serious', 'receiptdate'])
```
