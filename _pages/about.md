# Hey there!

My name is a Sami, I'm currently working as a data scientist with training in math, and music. This is my personal website where I share a bit more about my background and interests, as well as resources on things I enjoy learning.

I am originally from Macau, a tiny (6 square miles) seaside city in South Eastern China that is now known as Vegas in the East due to its large gambling and tourism industry. Historical fun fact : Macau is simultaneously [the first and the last European colony in Asia](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-12-22-9912220059-story.html).
