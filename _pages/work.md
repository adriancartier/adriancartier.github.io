# Bayer Crop Science

Through a conference I participated during graduate school, I found myself talking with someone from Monsanto (former company name, now acquired by Bayer) and got to learn more about the digital revolution that is happening in this field. Come to think of it, statistics, experimental design and data analysis had long been the backbone of agriculture, the difference now is that we have much more data, and tools that allow us to experiment, and make decisions using large scale of data.
