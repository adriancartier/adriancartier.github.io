**What it's like to work there?**

I joined Bayer through Monsanto in 2015, which it acquired in late 2016. I began as a co-op after meeting a member of the data science team from Monsanto at an applied math conference, who had encouraged me to apply to their co-op program. Most of the projects I have worked on projects that aim to provide data-driven tools to improve the decision-making process for the seed production pipeline, and creating more efficient and sustainable ways to farm.

**Some of the projects I worked on are:**

- Anomaly detection algorithm for farm IoT
- Geospatial modeling of microbial trials
- Mathematical modeling of corn pollination
- Predictive models for in-season operations and yield forecast
- Variable seeding rate recommendation


A common theme of these problems is that they all centered around building data science tools on the judicious use of geospatial and temporal observations from diverse sources, such as field history, weather, and imagery. I got to work with a highly competent team of technically-minded folks, designed research objectives, coded a lot in python and R, dabbled in different visualization tools, and most importantly, created decision-making tools that was impactful.

From a cultural perspective, Bayer fosters a vibrant global data science community where we regularly organize events such as data science hackathons, meetups, technical workshops and more. Among all the data science activities, one of my favorite is the **Women in Data Science** organization here at Bayer. I was fortunate to be one of the founding members of the Bayer internal group, as well as an ambassador of the St. Louis WiDS chapter, a branch from the [original group](https://www.widsconference.org/) founded in Stanford University. I got to work with many excellent women leaders and allies on a series of internal and external initiatives that aim to support a more inclusive community for technical talents, such as giving talks at and organizing the [**St. Louis WiDS conference**](https://www.stlmlds.com/widsspeakers). Check out some of the [social media mentions](https://twitter.com/hashtag/widsstl?lang=en) posts about our work.


## Medical College of Wisconsin (Internship) <a name="mcw"></a>

The University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee (my alma mater) and the Medical College of Wisconsin had quite a few joint research collaborations, I was lucky to be working with a professor that was involved in one of the research projects, and was selected to join in the research via an industrial math internship program, which extended a few more semesters after the initial course.

 The main problem our group was trying to solve was to identify a set of genes that would be informative for early onset type 1 diabetes. One of the main challenge in here is the [**curse of dimensionality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) - working with tens of thousands of gene expression features based on a very limited samples, as is a common in many clinical studies at the time. I researched and implemented multiple feature selection algorithms using Gaussian mixture modeling and random forest, as well as short time-series methods to understand the relationship between progression of T1D overtime as a function of different genes.

 As a part-time intern, I was assigned a specific project with well-defined goal. I got a chance to work closely with some of the research staff, lots of guidance from the principal investigator, but also freedom to try things out. Through this internship our group was able to publish a paper on this work, present at multiple conferences. For me, it was a great experience that paved the way to my career in data science and analytics.

## Transitioning from academia to industry <a name="transition"></a>

*Note*: This is by no means a guide to a job search, but just a summary of my experience as a mathematician working in industry.

**Why?**

Truth to be told, I had very little idea what I wanted to be when I grow up. I've always enjoyed math, and music, which is what I studied in college, but beyond that I didn't have a clue what the next steps should be. In my junior and senior years, I got to work as an undergraduate research assistant for a psychology professor working on color vision research. That changed things a bit for me, I got a sense of what it was like to do research, which helped me make the decision to pursue graduate studies. While I enjoyed very much the academic atmosphere, and got to work with many wonderful people, I decided that I'd prefer to apply my skills in the industry for two reasons :

 1.  The process for getting a tenure-track position is grueling, and extremely competitive, and often comes with trade-offs in opportunities for career advancement and years of financially security. For example, here are some good articles that describe what [it takes to land a tenure-track position](https://community.chronicle.com/news/1775-i-found-a-tenure-track-job-here-s-what-it-took)

 - crafting the questions, doing literature review, critically iterating on the problem-solution space by many, many trial and errors, and sharing your results hoping that this made a small progress on a getting the results reviewed critically. began thinking that graduate school would be a viable option, and so I decided to pursue a PhD in mathematics.

Soon after I moved to St. Louis for my first job, I got to know some cool people in the data science community. One of them suggested I consider becoming a mentor for a new [CoderGirl](https://www.launchcode.org/codergirl) data science track that LaunchCode's is starting. I was very happy to be part of this thriving community full of passionate women working together to organize a learning community that benefits everyone. Since its start in 2016, the data science track has grown from a meet-up style gathering to a full-fledged program with a dedicated curriculum, project portfolio, many success stories and a dedicated group of volunteer mentors, and students. We covered key skills in building a data science career including data analysis, statistics, data wrangling, machine learning and data science best practice. A few of work friends and former students in the track have joined the mentoring as well, check out the curriculum at their [github org.](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL)
